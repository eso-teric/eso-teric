Hi! I am eso-teric/nuke (github username was chosen due to lack of ideas for a name).
I am currently a high school student who is in the programming field of study.
I only have around 1.5 year of (non-commercial) experience with programming and it mainly consists of front-end.
Programming languages I'm learning/would like to learn in the future (as of January 2024):
  1. HTML - studying, would like to proceed further
  2. CSS - studying, would like to proceed further
  3. JS - trying to get the hang of it, it's definitely a lot more diverse.
  4. Python - currently in the process of self-learning, haven't touched the language in some time
  5. PHP - studying, haven't touched the language in a while, reconsidering whether or not if i want to pursue my knowledge in this language
  6. C# - studying, would like to proceed further
  7. MySQL - studying, would definitely like to proceed further
  8. React - just starting, it's a bit challenging
